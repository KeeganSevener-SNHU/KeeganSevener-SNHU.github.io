<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
<h2>Computer Science Journey</h2>
<p>
At the start of my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in 2022, I had minimal experience with coding languages and computer science coding standards such as pseudocode and flowcharts. Courses at SNHU taught me how to utilize these skills, collaborate in a team environment, and communicate with stakeholders. IT 140 Introduction to Scripting introduced me to pseudocode and flowcharts and how to use them for functional thinking and programming. The CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle, SDLC, enabled me to work within an agile framework like Scrum. I gained experience performing the duties of various roles such as the Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer, and Tester. I learned how these roles work together, the responsibilities they each have, and the importance of being flexible in a software development team.
</p>
<p>
The CS 250 course, in addition to the user interface/user experience (UI/UX) course CS 319 UI/UX Design and Development, helped me develop skills to communicate with stakeholders. In Scrum, the Product Owner is primarily responsible for communicating with stakeholders and ensuring that their requirements for the project are enacted. The CS 319 expanded on my stakeholder communication skills by giving me experience with developing paper prototypes for applications and interviewing potential users on those designs. I interviewed several people while having them interact with the prototypes, recorded their feedback, and integrated that feedback into revamped designs. This experience emphasized the importance of designing products with your audience in mind and not just focusing on what you personally want out of an application. This experience helped inform my approach in interface design for the artifacts in this ePortfolio.
</p>
<p>
Data structures and algorithms are an important facet of software design. The SNHU course CS 300 Data Structure and Algorithms or DSA: Analysis and Design gave me experience building various data structures for storage and their unique features. Prior to this course, I had little understanding of Binary Search Trees and hash tables but was familiar with vectors and arrays from a few previous courses. I learned to think critically about the different data structures that exist, their Big O time complexity, and how to balance the trade-offs between these different structures. The experience helped me evaluate what data structure to use in a given scenario for software engineering. The type of data being worked with and the amount of data being stored are important factors in determining the appropriate data structure. Sometimes, a simple array will work perfectly. Not everything needs to have a complicated solution, it just depends on the context.
</p>
<p>
I acquired important database skills in classes such as SNHU’s CS 340 Client/Server Development and Intro to Relational Databases from Sophia Learning. CS 340 taught me important skills for utilizing MongoDB and its various commands. I gained experience building create, read, update, delete functionality, also known as CRUD, for a database and constructing and interactive front-end for viewing and manipulating data. The Intro to Relational Databases gave me an overview of Structured Query Language (SQL) databases, their commands, the usefulness of joins for combing rows/tables and the importance of atomicity for transactions. These experiences gave me vital skills and knowledge regarding different types of databases.
</p>
<p>
Security and privacy have always been important topics to me. I particularly enjoyed learning about Security in more detail in SNHU courses such as CS 305 Software Security and CS 405 Secure Coding. I gained skills in addressing security flaws like SQL injections, buffer overflows, memory address access exploits, and more. I am knowledgeable of the important distinction between authentication and authorization. Authentication validates identity while authorization establishes the level of access a particular authenticated user should have. Security methods such as role-based access control, an authorization scheme, enhance not only security but also privacy by limiting the scope of a user’s access to data. Security is a vital part of all software and only becoming more important. That is why it is important to shift security “left” to early in the software development lifecycle and address it from the start. Security is important to me, so anticipating potential vulnerabilities in software comes naturally.

<h2>ePortfolio Artifacts</h2>
<p>
The artifacts in my ePortolio collectively show a focus on web development that prioritizes efficiency, security, and user experience. I applied enhancements to three categories from SNHU’s CS 499 Capstone. Enhancement one addresses Category One of software design and engineering. I took an admin web application built in the Angular framework and reconstructed it using the React libraries. The Angular framework and React libraries are both popular tools for constructing web applications but React is the more widely used of the two. The original artifact allowed a user to login and edit listings for coral reef trips in a browser.
</p>
<p>
I completely rebuilt the application from the ground up. The interface was completely redesigned with user-friendliness in mind. I enhanced the interface with more colors and organized the listing cards and made them uniform in size and layout. I created pop-up modals for additional listing information, modals for editing information, and an automatic redirect for logins. The code also features more contextual in-code comments than the original artifact to enable easy and quick understanding of the underlying functionality for other programmers.
</p>
<p>
My second set of enhancements addressed Capstone’s second category, data structures and algorithms. The artifact that I enhanced for Category Two is artifact two. The original artifact is a program which reads bids from a comma separated values (CSV) file and stores them within a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. I enhanced this artifact by transforming its BST into a B-tree while maintaining all the functions of adding bids, searching for a bid, deleting a bid, and printing all bids in numerical order. The B-tree in the new program can accomplish all the same tasks as the original artifact, but with greater speed and efficiency.
</p>
<p>
My third set of enhancements for Category Three, databases, was made to artifact one. Artifact one contains a server application programming interface, API. This API was responsible for communicating with a MongoDB database. I enhanced the API by adding an authorization scheme in addition to its existing authentication methods. I also extended its authentication method to its read operations and added a delete operation to enable full create, read, update, delete functionality for the server. These changes were accompanied by additional changes to the elements created in Category One to fully enable the new API.
</p>
<p>
These artifacts in whole show an ability to create a web application which can be easily used by a person within a web browser regardless of technical prowess. The artifacts prioritize ease of use and visual appeal with the Category One enhancements. Category Two showcases my ability to prioritize and implement an algorithmic solution which enhances speed and efficiency for a given set of data. This is especially important in web applications, as no one likes to wait for a response from a server. The enhancements for Category Three show my high focus on the security and privacy of a given application and database. The enhancements to these artifacts show a culmination of skills that I have acquired over the course of my Computer Science program.
