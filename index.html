<h1>Welcome to Keegan's ePortfolio</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to review my ePortfolio. My name is Keegan Sevener, and I created this ePortfolio as a part of my Final Project for the CS 499 Capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. In this ePortfolio, I will discuss my journey through my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, SNHU, and the skills I have attained over the course of my program in my professional self-assessment. The assessment will then provide a summary of the artifacts I enhanced for this ePortfolio, links to the artifacts, and why they were chosen for this ePortfolio. There are three narratives that address the three categories of skills prescribed by the Capstone to fulfill five course outcomes. The three categories are software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases.
	</p>
	<p>
	The five course outcomes are as follows. One, employing strategies for building collaborative environments for diverse audiences. Two, designing and delivering professional and coherent oral/written/visual communications for a specific audience. Three, evaluate and design computing solutions using algorithmic principles while balancing trade-offs. Four, demonstrate the ability to use well-found and innovative techniques, tools, and skills to accomplish industry-specific goals. Five, develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits, mitigates design flaws, and ensures privacy and security of data.
	</p>
	<p>
	For the narratives that follow the professional self-assessment, each narrative details the artifact’s functionality, their enhancements, and the process of enhancing the artifacts. The narratives also address which course category they fall under and which of the Capstone’s five course outcomes the artifact enhancements align with. 
	</p>
	<p>
	As part of the Capstone, I recorded an informal code review video which addressed each artifact. I discussed each artifact’s existing functionality, issues, and enhancements. The video was recorded prior to making the enhancements and was polished using instructor feedback. The video also addresses which artifacts fall under which category and what course outcomes they align with. The code review video is hosted on YouTube and a link to it is listed among the links to the professional self-assessment and narrative pages below.
