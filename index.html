  <h4>Narratives <br> Enhancement One</h4>
    <p>  The artifact for Category One, Software Design and Engineering, is an administrative interface for a fictional website called Travlr Getaways. The artifact is from the CS465 Full Stack Development I course at Southern New Hampshire University and was built earlier this year. The application allows a signed in user to update and create new coral reef trip listings. The application was built in the Angular framework.</p>
  
  <p>  I chose to rebuild this artifact using the React libraries to showcase my expertise in web development and my ability to utilize different web frameworks and libraries. I made several changes to the website’s layout and design to showcase my knowledge and abilities with the React libraries, CSS, and JavaScript. The original artifact’s trip listings were less organized and unappealing to look at. I re-designed the listing cards to be more colorful and formatted them to be more visually appealing. I enhanced the listings by moving most of their information into a modal box that displays more information about each listing. The modal pops up in an animated fashion, and the user does not have to navigate to a new screen to view the information since the modal box opens on the current window. When viewing the modal, the user is presented with a sidebar modal with options to add new listings, edit the current one, or delete the current listing. Clicking on the edit or add button will open a new modal with a form for filling out the information for a new listing or editing the information for the current one. The edit modal form will autofill the input boxes with information from the listing the user was viewing. Another addition was an auto redirect from the main page to the login page. In the original artifact, a user would go to the home page and see all the listing information. The React app will also redirect users who are not logged in to the login page.</p>
  
  <p>When enhancing the artifact, some of the changes I wanted to make required learning some new things. I have worked with HTML modals in the past, but adding the CSS animation was new, but not difficult to learn. I learned about the nuances between Reacts useRef and useState libraries, such as how states will cause the component to re-render, but useRef will not, or how useEffect’s reactive tendencies enabled me to seamlessly set up the redirect function. I used these libraries during testing while developing but only ended up using useEffect in the final product. The knowledge gained on their differences and uses will be valuable moving forward.</p>
  
  <p>Another great lesson was the value of Reacts Context libraries. The createContext and useContext allow me to pass information between React components without prop-drilling. Prop-drilling is a process where variables and functions are passed down through multiple components as ‘properties’, like passing variables into a method. In my React app I pass information into the ListingCard component, which then passes the same information into the MoreInfoCard component. This is an instance prop-drilling that makes sense given that both components need this information. However, if a variable or function needs to be passed to one component, it can be cumbersome to try and pass it down multiple times, not to mention difficult to maintain, and the Context libraries make sharing variables and functions much easier. The challenges I faced in constructing the app were the normal sorts of issues a programmer runs into when developing, such as working out the fine details for margins between text or ensuring the redirect does not continue operating after a user logs in.</p>
  
  <p>I have met the course outcomes that I planned to meet with the planned enhancements to this artifact. The artifact aligns with course outcome One. The Category One artifact features ample code comments that make the code easily readable, understandable, and maintainable without becoming excessive. The admin application is also easy for people to navigate regardless of technical prowess, serving a diverse range of people by not being limited to just the technically savvy person. The artifact aligns with course outcome Two. The code comments clearly articulate the idea and intent behind each component and how they work together to create the web application. The comments are mindful of their audience and assume the reader has familiarity with React. However, the comments are also structured to help programmers with little-to-no knowledge of React quickly understand how the Travlr Getaways admin application works.</p>
  
  <p>Outcome Four is met by the Travlr Getaways application’s utilization of best practices with industry tools such as the React libraries which are common for web development. The application makes good use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript XML and React to more efficiently deliver the value of the original artifact in a more robust and innovative manner. There are no changes to my outcome-coverage plans. I still plan to meet outcomes Three and Five with the artifacts for Category Two and Category Three respectively. Category Three, Databases, will cover Outcome Five for developing a security mindset. Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures will fulfill outcome Three with a solution to a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices.</p>

  <h4>Enhancement Two</h4>
    <p>For enhancement Category Two, I chose an artifact from my SNHU class CS 300: Data Structure and Algorithms or DSA: Analysis and Design. This artifact was created in June of 2024, and it is a data structure program that stores bid objects that it generates using a CSV.
I selected this artifact to showcase my skill and ability to discern appropriate data structures and algorithmic solutions to a given problem and implement those solutions. The data structure was originally a binary search tree, or BST. I enhanced the artifact and optimized the data structure algorithm by changing it to a B-tree. BSTs and B-trees have an average time complexity of O(log n). However, BSTs can degrade to a time complexity of O(n) in worst case scenarios. These worst-case scenarios can arise based on how data is inserted into the tree, making them unbalanced, or if there is simply a lot of data in the tree. B-trees are self-balancing and store more than one piece of data per node in their tree. This allows them to balance themselves out and maintain a time complexity of O(log n). Given that one of the CSV files in this project contains over 12,000 bids, the B-tree is a big improvement over the binary search tree and makes the data structure more efficient given its dataset. I also enhanced the input function by adding input validation to ensure the program does not error out when the user inputs an invalid command or data type. The input function also provides feedback to the user on what qualifies as proper input.
</p>
  <p>I fulfilled the enhancement plan I outlined in Module One and met the requirements for outcome Three by translating the bid program from a BST into a B-tree. I have implemented a B-tree as a solution to the given problem, storing a large dataset of bid objects, after evaluating the trade-offs between the B-tree and the BST.
The only change in my outcome-coverage plans is that my code review will contribute to course outcomes One and Two. I have met outcomes One, Two, and Four with the enhancements in Category One, and my polished code review. My code review contributes to outcome One as it demonstrates my ability to employ collaborative code reviews on an individual and team environment. I recorded the code review by myself but with the intention of it being viewed by other people. The code review also meets course outcome Two because I created an orally narrated review adapted to its intended audience, specifically my instructor. I still plan to meet outcome Five, developing a security mindset, with my Category Three enhancements. Aspects of my B-tree program have also contributed to outcome Five, such as the input validation to ensure secure interaction between the program and a user.</p>
<p>Creating the B-tree was challenging, with the most frequent issue encountered being out-of-bound memory readings which would cause the program to crash. I learned how vital it is to keep good track of the number of objects stored within a given node, to ensure that the program did not try to accidentally access an object or a node that did not exist. I also discovered it was easier to track the tree’s leaves by assigning a Boolean variable to each node. I tried to track leaves by checking that their child pointer arrays were completely null, which required a lot of loop checks and just made things more difficult than they needed to be. I learned that the key to keeping the tree balanced ultimately lay in ensuring bid objects are moved around during insert and removal operations when necessary to maintain a balanced tree. The number of times the tree rebalances its nodes and bids occur more often than I anticipated. I often had to revisit the logic of a given operation and properties B-tree for guidance on proper implementation. The most interesting aspect of B-trees that I learned was how they will rebalance nodes they pass during delete operations if those nodes have too few keys, or bids in my artifacts case. Moving bids around to maintain a certain count within a given node is crucial to maintaining the structure of the B-tree.
