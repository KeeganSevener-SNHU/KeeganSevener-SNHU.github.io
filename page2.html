<h1>Enhancement One Narrative</h1>
 <p>  The artifact for Category One, Software Design and Engineering, is an administrative interface for a fictional website called Travlr Getaways. The artifact is from the CS465 Full Stack Development I course at Southern New Hampshire University and was built earlier this year. The application allows a signed in user to update and create new coral reef trip listings. The application was built in the Angular framework.</p>
  
  <p>  I chose to rebuild this artifact using the React libraries to showcase my expertise in web development and my ability to utilize different web frameworks and libraries. I made several changes to the website’s layout and design to showcase my knowledge and abilities with the React libraries, CSS, and JavaScript. The original artifact’s trip listings were less organized and unappealing to look at. I re-designed the listing cards to be more colorful and formatted them to be more visually appealing. I enhanced the listings by moving most of their information into a modal box that displays more information about each listing. The modal pops up in an animated fashion, and the user does not have to navigate to a new screen to view the information since the modal box opens on the current window. When viewing the modal, the user is presented with a sidebar modal with options to add new listings, edit the current one, or delete the current listing. Clicking on the edit or add button will open a new modal with a form for filling out the information for a new listing or editing the information for the current one. The edit modal form will autofill the input boxes with information from the listing the user was viewing. Another addition was an auto redirect from the main page to the login page. In the original artifact, a user would go to the home page and see all the listing information. The React app will also redirect users who are not logged in to the login page.</p>
  
  <p>When enhancing the artifact, some of the changes I wanted to make required learning some new things. I have worked with HTML modals in the past, but adding the CSS animation was new, but not difficult to learn. I learned about the nuances between Reacts useRef and useState libraries, such as how states will cause the component to re-render, but useRef will not, or how useEffect’s reactive tendencies enabled me to seamlessly set up the redirect function. I used these libraries during testing while developing but only ended up using useEffect in the final product. The knowledge gained on their differences and uses will be valuable moving forward.</p>
  
  <p>Another great lesson was the value of Reacts Context libraries. The createContext and useContext allow me to pass information between React components without prop-drilling. Prop-drilling is a process where variables and functions are passed down through multiple components as ‘properties’, like passing variables into a method. In my React app I pass information into the ListingCard component, which then passes the same information into the MoreInfoCard component. This is an instance prop-drilling that makes sense given that both components need this information. However, if a variable or function needs to be passed to one component, it can be cumbersome to try and pass it down multiple times, not to mention difficult to maintain, and the Context libraries make sharing variables and functions much easier. The challenges I faced in constructing the app were the normal sorts of issues a programmer runs into when developing, such as working out the fine details for margins between text or ensuring the redirect does not continue operating after a user logs in.</p>
  
  <p>I have met the course outcomes that I planned to meet with the planned enhancements to this artifact. The artifact aligns with course outcome One. The Category One artifact features ample code comments that make the code easily readable, understandable, and maintainable without becoming excessive. The admin application is also easy for people to navigate regardless of technical prowess, serving a diverse range of people by not being limited to just the technically savvy person. The artifact aligns with course outcome Two. The code comments clearly articulate the idea and intent behind each component and how they work together to create the web application. The comments are mindful of their audience and assume the reader has familiarity with React. However, the comments are also structured to help programmers with little-to-no knowledge of React quickly understand how the Travlr Getaways admin application works.</p>
  
  <p>Outcome Four is met by the Travlr Getaways application’s utilization of best practices with industry tools such as the React libraries which are common for web development. The application makes good use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript XML and React to more efficiently deliver the value of the original artifact in a more robust and innovative manner. There are no changes to my outcome-coverage plans. I still plan to meet outcomes Three and Five with the artifacts for Category Two and Category Three respectively. Category Three, Databases, will cover Outcome Five for developing a security mindset. Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures will fulfill outcome Three with a solution to a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices.</p>
